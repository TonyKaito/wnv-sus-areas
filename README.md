# Comparing West Nile Virus Intervention Strategies using Mathematical Modeling and comparing methods to curtail the spread

By: Samarth Halyal, Alexander Golubow, Anthony Lam

Abstract: During 1962 â€“ 1963, Camargue, South France, saw an outbreak of mosquito-borne disease. Later in 1996, an epidemic occurred in Europe, during which countries like Romania identified about 400 cases. This disease which causes fever and other related symptoms, was named West Nile Virus (WNV). The virus is now found throughout the world across the continental United States, Europe, Africa, The Middle East, and west Asia. In this paper, we will discuss the spread of WNV and its future trajectory based on the temperature and climate of regions. We will show how intervention strategies such as adulticides and mosquito repellents will change the graph of the model.
